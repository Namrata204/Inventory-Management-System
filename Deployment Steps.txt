To deploy Product service on Kubernetes, we can follow these steps:

1. Build Docker Image:
     docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> .
   
2. Push Docker Image to a Registry:
     docker push <image-name>:<tag>

3. Create a Kubernetes Deployment:
   - Create a Kubernetes deployment manifest file (e.g., `product-deployment.yaml`) with the following content:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: product-service
     spec:
       replicas: 1
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: product-service
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: product-service
         spec:
           containers:
             - name: product-service
               image: <image-name>:<tag>
               ports:
                 - containerPort: <container-port>
     ```
   - Replace `<image-name>:<tag>` with the name and tag of your Docker image.
   - Replace `<container-port>` with the port number on which your Product service listens.

4. Apply Deployment:
   - Apply the deployment manifest to create the deployment in Kubernetes:
     kubectl apply -f product-deployment.yaml     

5. Expose the Service:
   - If we want to expose Product service externally, we can create a Kubernetes service manifest file (e.g., `product-service.yaml`) with the following content:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: product-service
     spec:
       type: LoadBalancer
       ports:
         - port: <service-port>
           targetPort: <container-port>
       selector:
         app: product-service
     ```
   - Replace `<service-port>` with the desired port number for the service to be exposed externally.
   - Replace `<container-port>` with the port number on which your Product service listens.

6. Apply Service:
   - Apply the service manifest to create the service in Kubernetes:
     kubectl apply -f product-service.yaml
  

After executing these commands, Kubernetes will create the necessary deployment and service for the Product service. You can access the service using the exposed external IP and port provided by the LoadBalancer service, or the cluster IP and port if you are accessing it within the cluster.
